# E-commerce-Web-Application
This is my first web applicaiton. Through this application we can see available products, we can add products in our shopping cart. After that we can check our shopping cart what kind of products we add in our cart with product price. We can also search our targeted products. If we want to increase quantity we can use up arrow and for decrease quantity we can use down arrow. After that we can go checkout porcess if user is already loged in then they will just provide shipping address, after we can see payment option. When we will complete payment we will able to see popup menu with message "Transection Completed" and we will go back our main page when we will click ok button. This project is user friendly any non-technical user also easily use this application. I will implement more option in this projects.

How we can run the application:

First of all we have to visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python version 3.7 or 3.8 or most update version. when download will be completed we should install it in our operation system with when you will go to install python we will see Add path option please check this option to add path.
